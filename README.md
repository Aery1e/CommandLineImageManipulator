A command-line program that reads an image file from disk, performs image manipulation operations given as command-line arguments, and writes the modified image back to disk.
Able to import and export .ppm and .sbu files (A format which stores pixel colors in a color table, followed by data which are indices to that color table)
Implements File I/O and Image Manipulation. 
Supported command line arguments:
 -i : Path to input file
   Ex. -i "/home/testing/moon.ppm"
   Load the moon.ppm image file stored in the /home/testing directory.
   
 -o : Path to output file
   Ex. -o "/home/testing/sun.sbu"
   Save the processed image in a file named sun.sbu in the local /home/testing directory.
   
 -c : Rectangular region to copy pixels from
   Ex. -c 5,8,20,30
   Select the region starting at the pixel at row 5, column 8 that is 20 columns wide and 30 rows high. The lower-right corner of this region would be at the pixel at row 34, column 27.
   
   requires four parameters separated by commas: row, col, width and height:
    row: the row number of the upper-left pixel of the region (0-based indexing)
    col: the column number of the upper-left pixel of the region (0-based indexing)
    width: the width of the entire region, in pixels (i.e., the number of columns spanned)
    height: the height of the entire region, in pixels (i.e., the number of rows spanned)
  
-p: Paste the copied contents into the image
   Ex. -p 19,50
   Paste the contents of the copied region starting at row 19, column 50, overwriting the pixels at the region covered by the pasted content.
   requires a row and col value.
    row: the row number of the upper-left pixel of the image where the copied region’s upper-left corner should be positioned for pasting (0-based indexing)
    col: the column number of the upper-left pixel of the image where the copied region’s upper-left corner should be positioned for pasting (0-based indexing)
  
  -r: Print a message on top of the image
    Ex. -r "new YORK state","fonts/font3.txt",1,10,5
    Prints a message on top of the image in white (RGB = (255,255,255)), with the upper-left corner of the first letter’s bounding box positioned at the given row and column in the image.
    equires five parameters separated by commas: mrow, col, width and height
      message: the message to display, given in double quotation marks.
      path_to_font: the path to the file containing the font file, given in double quotation marks.
      font_size: the integer multiplier used to increase the size of the text horizontally and vertically
      row: the row number of the upper-left pixel of the image where the upper-left corner of the first letter’s bounding box should be positioned when printing the message into the image
      col: the column number of the upper-left pixel of the image where the upper-left corner of the first letter’s bounding box should be positioned when printing the message into the image
